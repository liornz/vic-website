This work is based on a unique ceramic object that is intended to reflect the fragility and layers of the human body. The ceramic object is held by a rope made of braided human hair. There is here reference to the contrast between the heavy and the light and the instability of an object held by a thin thread. An implicit reference is made to the fragility and sensibility of life.
