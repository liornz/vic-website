The leitmotif of this work has to do with the notion of structure and connection between organs. There is an implicit reference to those structural elements which, despite their fragile nature, are nevertheless required to hold the whole intact and to provide stability. One would have expected the structural elements to be the strongest but as it turns out they are no less fragile and sensitive than the content they are designed to protect. In an analogy to a living organism, the fragile body of these works is held intact by a no less fragile structure.
