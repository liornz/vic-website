This installation makes reference to moment when a blood vessel is cut and to the blood flowing from the veins. The ceramic tubes are hand-made and refer to the fragility of our body. They are each unique and their inner part resembles the shape of arteries. The red paprika powder, which in some societies is used as a natural remedy, refers to the flowing of the blood but also to the attempt to heal the wounded body.
