Here the general appeal to the notion of fragility is supplemented with the contrast between the plaster vertebra and its bronze counterpart. A reference is made to the organic body, which at times of crisis needs to be reinforced by embedding non-organic pieces within the organic structure and by replacing living tissue with an artificial prosthesis. Despite our best intentions, the non-organic material is evident within the organic body. This work therefore concerns itself with giving evidence to those elements which are absent and with our attempt to cover up for those missing elements by using replacements, an attempt which, despite our best intentions, succeeds in achieving the exact opposite.
Aside from the contrast between the materials used there is also an appeal to the contrast between classical bronze sculpture and the more modern use of plaster for the same purpose.
