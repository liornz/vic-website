The work represents a modern attempt to deal with the traditional notion of vanity, which has a long history in art. It therefore refers to the contrast between the notions of beauty and decay. The image of the golden skull combines the notions of on the one hand death and on the other hand beauty and luxury. The butterflies represent the circle of life and the bitter realization that life is short, fragile but nevertheless priceless.
