This work is based on a unique ceramic object that is intended to reflect the fragility and layers of the human body. The ceramic object is penetrated by a metal rode and there is an implicit reference to the insertion of needles or other medical objects into the human tissue. The latex makes reference to the deterioration of the skin and pain.
