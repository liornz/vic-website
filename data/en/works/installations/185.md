The work is a modern interpretation of the “pieta” in art history. The title of the work refers to the height of the artist himself and implies the artist’s dead body held by his mother. The structure of this work is intended to reflect lightness and the organic pattern refers to the deterioration of the organic form and the abstract transition from body to soul.
