This work documents a personal process of confronting various aspects of life â€“ or perhaps death, which we normally tend to avoid. This work invites us to embrace precisely those elements regarded as unpleasant. The work has an implicit reference to various contrasts all revolving around the notions of on the one hand pain, sickness, deterioration and even death and on the other hand peacefulness, gentleness and beauty. There is also reference here to the symbol of a cross and an implicit reference to the relation between the notions of religion and science.
