We can approach the issue of identity from two distinct aspects. We can focus on the individual, personal aspect of identity, which highlights the uniqueness of the individual in contrast to other human beings or we can focus on the social aspect, which highlights the shared aspects of identity, through which we become part of a community. From the social point of view we define ourselves as belonging to an ethnic group, a nationality, gender, as part of a shared ideology etc.
This artwork attempts to combine the two points of view â€“ the individual and the social. The Jerba plant is used to make Mate, a sort of tea that is common is some parts of South America. One usually drink it with friends and therefore as part of a group. However, the Jerba powder is used here to make the pattern of a fingerprint, which is a unique aspect of our identity.
