At the basis pf this work is a deep feeling of frustration and instability. The displayed items reflect, each in its own way, the elements of a deep crisis, which is projected onto the future. This sense of frustration is expressed as a sort of wound or dislocation of elements. In other cases this frustration can manifest itself as processes of deterioration and the falling-apart of the organic tissue. The frustration spreads without any ability to stop its spread.
