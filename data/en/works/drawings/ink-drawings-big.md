All Ink Works make an implicit reference to an open wound. The wire which runs through each piece makes the burning sensation of the open wound even more explicit. It is a rusted or barbed wire, associated with fences, which divide people and acts like a wound. However, that which divides us also connects us this may reflect some hope. The wire was taken from a conflict zone, regarding which the artist has an ambivalent emotional relation.
### Judas
The shape of this work is reminiscent of a heart and is referred to Judas’ betrayal of Jesus. Judas betrayed his friend, whom he also loved and according to some interpretations hanged himself as an act of remorse. This sort of motivation, these drives and mixed emotions are active in all humans and are responsible for relations between individuals and people throughout human history. Judas, and the conflicts his story brings out, is therefore present within us all. In this work the background color is purple which signifies power.
### Cain and Abel
This work has an implicit reference to the story of Cain and Abel. Here one can see that the two pieces of paper are cut out of one original piece, just like the two brothers. The original piece of paper was in this case cut in half by pouring water, which signifies purity. Unlike the ink, the water does not leave traces behind. Still one can see the painful evidence of the traumatic split. The story of Cain and Abel of course has to do with jealousy, pride and anger. The color used as background in this work is yellow associated with the above emotions.
### Bleeding Thorns
The work has reference to the crown of thorns believed to have been placed on Jesus’ head prior to his crucifixion. This is usually taken to symbolize the obsession of Jesus’ captors in causing him pain. In this work, the background color used is therefore red which signifies lust, passion but also love. Moreover, the crown is usually associated with power and authority but in the biblical story it was used as a form of humiliation and mockery. This can be seen as a metaphor. We all want to be crowned but do we really deserve this crown. Does the act of crowning really gives us power and dignity or is it just a form of vanity?
